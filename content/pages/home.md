Women in Tech Allies is a group to advocate for diversity in technology through networking, tech talks, mentor-ship, etc. We look for opportunities to support our current peers in tech, women attempting to transition into tech from other backgrounds, as well as helping our youth grow into future tech leaders. 

We believe that change comes from within. For the technology and developer community to become more inclusive and accessible for women and other under-represented demographics, those already within the community must be part of that change.

Women in Tech Allies is a space to apply your interests, expertise, experience, knowledge, support and encouragement to promote new tech talent. We encourage all genders, races, and backgrounds to join our meetup and the tech community.
