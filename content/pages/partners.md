  # We have amazing Partners & Sponsors


  How did we build an amazing community? We have great sponsors.  They provide
  space for hosting, food and drinks for a festive atmosphere and hook us up
  with talented presenters.  WITA would be nothing without their continuous and
  unfailing support.

  Insight (formerly Cardinal Solutions) is were WITA began.  So many of the
  ideas and goals for Women In Tech Allies were started through conversations
  and brain-storming with this awesome group of people. The RTP branch went on
  to sponsor and host our very first meetings, lend talented speakers for events
  and just generally be a fantastic resource for promoting positive change in
  the tech community. 


  Insight is a leader in providing smart, cutting-edge technology solutions for
  global organizations of all sizes.  As an Award Winning Microsoft Partner,
  they have the capabilities to create cutting edge solutions in any industry.
